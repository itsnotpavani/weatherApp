# weatherApp
Weather App that uses a weather API ton display the weather of the city or country entered via text or speech
I developed this project initially as a weather App that displays the weather of the city or country you give in the input.It used a weather Api to fetch the information based on the the input city name.Later I explored the Speech Recognition Api that comes with javascript and then I incorporated voice search in my project.
In order to search using Voice Say:What is the weather in /*City name or country name*/
example:What is the weather in Delhi
Voice search only works if you say like stated above
The project is locally hosted on local host 3000
You need to do the necessary things like :
npm init
npm install express body-parser
